    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>

        
        
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher and (somewhat) a software developer. I study the security of all sorts of systems, improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from it.</p> 


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p>I went to DefCon, took lots of pictures. Need to sort through those then I will post a link</p>
         <p>Lately my health has been getting MUCH better, and as a result I am finding I have more time for <strike> slacking off</strike> Bug bounties, of which I cannot currently discuss.
         <h2>Contact info</h2>
