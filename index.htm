    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>It is meant to be a simple website. No flashy javascript menus or anything like that.

        
        
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher and (somewhat) a software developer. I study the security of all sorts of systems, improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from it. 


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p>I went to DefCon, took <a href="https://therevenge.me/~jtl/defcon">some pictures</a>
         <br>Lately my health has been getting MUCH better, and as a result I am finding I have more time for <strike> slacking off</strike> Bug bounties, of which I cannot currently discuss.
         <h2>Contact info</h2>
