        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher. I study the security of all sorts of systems improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from them.</p> 
        <p>Most notably I've discovered vulnerabilities in Telus's Actiontec modem/router and gained some fame from it.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in the idea of finding a vulnerability in a large website, doing a writeup on it, etc. Off to work I go.</p>


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p>I went to DefCon, took lots of pictures. Need to sort through those then I will post a link</p>
