    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>It is meant to be a simple website. No flashy javascript menus or anything like that.

        
        
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher and (somewhat) a software developer. I study the security of all sorts of systems, improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from it. 


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p>I went to DefCon, took <a href="https://cdn.jtl.pw/defcon">some pictures</a>
         <br>Currently working on programming and bug bounties. Have some writeups planned, including a vulnerability I found in a large company but did not get a bounty for.
