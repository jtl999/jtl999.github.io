    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>It is meant to be a simple website. No flashy javascript menus or anything like that.

        
        
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher and (somewhat) a software developer. I study the security of all sorts of systems, improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from it. 


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p>Well my eyesight is *kind of* getting worse and causing headaches, etc. Makes programming rather difficult, don't you think?
         <br> I didn't go to DEF CON this year :(

         <p>Currently working on my health, <strike>programming and bug bounties</strike>. Have some writeups planned, including a vulnerability I found in a service that got gobbled up in a corporate acquisition, and is being shut down in a few months.
