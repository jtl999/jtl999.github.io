    <h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
    <p>It is meant to be a simple website. No flashy javascript menus or anything like that.

        
        
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm best described as a security researcher and (somewhat) a software developer. I study the security of all sorts of systems, improve them and <i>most</i> importantly improve my knowledge from it.</p> 


         <h2>Recent things</h2>
         <p> I'm glad to say it, but after 6 years my vision is finally starting to get better.
         I've been working on many projects including reverse engineering of some embedded devices, a Python based forum/social platform for private use, and more!
         <p>I hope to work on bug bounties soon.
         <p>Also thinking of starting a blog after I start the above.</p>
